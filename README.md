### Hi there, i'm Phil ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a passionate self-taught web developer from the UK. I wrote my first piece of code in the autumn of 2020 and have never looked back. I love to learn about new technologies and implement them to solve problems and create quality web applications. My only regret is that I didn't start learning sooner.

I joined a startup as a full-stack developer in March 2021 - it was subsequently bought out by a big multi-national firm (SoftwareOne) where I have been employed ever since. Our tech stack is Javascript, and we use MongoDB with Graphql - I also know my way around AWS and have built lambdas etc for some of our codebase.

Always learning, always growing.

Below is a list of some of the technologies I have used in my web applications:
